KRYPTON 1: KRYPTONISGREAT
just throw the contents of krypton2 into a rot13 decoder

KRYPTON 2: ROTTEN
Create a test file containing ABCD
run the ecrypt program on it, 
notice the output is MNOP
the letters were shifted by 12
Therefor, they are encrypted by ROT12 and 
	decrypted by ROT(26-12) = ROT14

running ROT14 on the contents of krypton3 gives
CAESARISEASY

KRYPTON 3 : CAESARISEASY
To find the substitution method used, 
copy the contents of found 1-3 and paste into a Monoalphabetic 
substitution decoder, which will analyze the frequency of the 
letters and create a substitution alphabet

then use that alphabet on krypton4
