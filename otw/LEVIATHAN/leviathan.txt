the password is just in the bookmakrsk.html file, if you open the file in a web browser and ctrl-f for password, you can click the link and you'll get the password

if you cat check, you will notice at the top the words "love sex secret god"
if you google this, you'll find that it is a reference to the movie hackers.
there is a quote in the movie that says “The Four Most-Used Passwords Are Love, Sex, Secret, and God”
sex is the password.
once youre in, you enter sh as leviathan2. cat the contents of /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2

create a temp directory, 
run : ltrace ./printfile /tmp/darthsmegma/a

notice that the program checks access for "/tmp/darthsmegma/a"
then it calls system(%s)

modify directory so that it contains:
/tmp/darthsmegma/a etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3

now, we can cd to /
then run home/leviathan2/printfile "/tmp/darthsmegma/a etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3"

when we do this, the program checks for access of the full string above, which checks out fine since user leviathan2 created that file. But, cat works differently. It will instead run 
cat /tmp/darthsmegma/a
cat etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3

which will give us the password

LEVIATHAN 3: Ahdiemoo1j
run ltrace ./level3
enter anything, then notice there is a strcmp(whatever you entered, "snlprintf\n")
this tells us the first password is snlprintf
run ./level3 again and enter the pass word
we enter sh
run id
notice we are now uid=12004, leviathan4
cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4

LEVIATHAN 4: vuH0coox6m
run the program in .trash
convert binary to text
done

LEVIATHAN 5: Tith4cokei
running ltrace ./leviathan5 shows that the program just prints out the contents of /tmp/file.log
create a symlink from /tmp/file.log to /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 
then run ./leviathan5
